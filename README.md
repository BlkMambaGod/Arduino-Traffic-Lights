# 🚦 Arduino Traffic Light Simulation

This project is a **beginner-friendly Arduino simulation** of a traffic light at an intersection.  
It was built as a showcase of the concepts I learned during my first year of computer science.

## 📌 Features
- Simulates a standard traffic light cycle (green → yellow → red).
- **LEDs** represent the different light states.
- **7-segment display** shows a countdown timer for the lights.
- **8-bit shift register** controls multiple LEDs efficiently.
- **Push button** to simulate pedestrian crossing request.
- **Infrared detector** to sense vehicle presence and adjust the light cycle.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- Red, Yellow, Green LEDs  
- 7-Segment LED Display  
- 74HC595 8-bit Shift Register  
- Push Button  
- Infrared Sensor Module  
- Resistors, Breadboard, Jumper Wires, USB cable
